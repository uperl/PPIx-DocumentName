## OO

=method extract

  my $docname = PPIx::DocumentName->extract( $ppi_document );

This will first attempt to extract a name via the C<PODNAME: > comment notation,
and then fall back to using a C<package Package::Name> statement.

C<$ppi_document> is ideally a C<PPI::Document>, but will be auto-up-cast if it is
any of the parameters C<< PPI::Document->new() >> understands.

=cut

sub extract {
  my ( $self, $ppi_document ) = @_;
  my $docname = $self->extract_via_comment($ppi_document)
    || $self->extract_via_statement($ppi_document);

  return $docname;
}

=method extract_via_statement

  my $docname = PPIx::DocumentName->extract_via_statement( $ppi_document );

This only extract C<package Package::Name> statement based document names.

C<$ppi_document> is ideally a C<PPI::Document>, but will be auto-up-cast if it is
any of the parameters C<< PPI::Document->new() >> understands.

=cut

sub extract_via_statement {
  my ( undef, $ppi_document ) = @_;

  # Keep alive until done
  # https://github.com/adamkennedy/PPI/issues/112
  my $dom      = _Document($ppi_document);
  my $pkg_node = $dom->find_first('PPI::Statement::Package');
  if ( not $pkg_node ) {
    log_debug { "No PPI::Statement::Package found in <<$ppi_document>>" };
    return;
  }
  if ( not $pkg_node->namespace ) {
    log_debug { "PPI::Statement::Package $pkg_node has empty namespace in <<$ppi_document>>" };
    return;
  }
  return $pkg_node->namespace;
}

=method extract_via_comment

  my $docname = PPIx::DocumentName->extract_via_comment( $ppi_document );

This will only extract C<PODNAME: > comment based document names.

C<$ppi_document> is ideally a C<PPI::Document>, but will be auto-up-cast if it is
any of the parameters C<< PPI::Document->new() >> understands.

=cut

sub extract_via_comment {
  my ( undef, $ppi_document ) = @_;
  my $regex = qr{ ^ \s* \#+ \s* PODNAME: \s* (.+) $ }x;    ## no critic (RegularExpressions)
  my $content;
  my $finder = sub {
    my $node = $_[1];
    return 0 unless $node->isa('PPI::Token::Comment');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains a few utilities for extracting a "name" out of an arbitrary Perl file.

Typically, this is the C<module> name, in the form:

  package Foo

However, it also supports extraction of an override statement in the form:

  # PODNAME: OverrideName::Goes::Here

Which may be more applicable for documents that lack a C<package> statement, or the C<package>
statement may be "wrong", but they still need the document parsed under the guise of having a name
( for purposes such as POD )

=head1 USAGE

The recommended approach is simply:

  use PPIx::DocumentName;

  # Get a PPI Document Somehow
  return PPIx::DocumentName->extract( $ppi_document );

=head1 ALTERNATIVE NAMES

Other things I could have called this

=over 4

=item * C<PPIx::PodName> - But it isn't, because it doesn't extract from C<POD>, only returns data that may be useful B<FOR>
C<POD>

=item * C<PPIx::ModuleName> - But it kinda isn't either, because its more generic than that and is tailored to extracting
"a name" out of any PPI Document, and they're I<NOT> all modules.

=back

=head1 SIMILAR MODULES

Modules that are perceptibly similar to this ones tasks ( but are subtly different in important ways ) are as follows:

=over 4

=item * L<< C<Module::Metadata>|Module::Metadata >> - Module::Metadata does a bunch of things this module explicitly doesn't
want or need to do, and it lacks a bunch of features this module needs.

Module::Metadata is predominantly concerned with extracting I<ALL> name spaces and I<ALL> versions from a module for the
purposes of indexing and indexing related tasks. This also means it has a notion of "hideable" name spaces with the purpose
of hiding them from C<CPAN>.

Due to being core as well, it is not able to use C<PPI> for its features, so the above concerns mean it is also mostly
based on careful regex parsing, which can easily be false tripped on miscellaneous in document content.

Whereas C<PPIx::DocumentName> only cares about the I<first> name of a given class, and it cares much more about nested
strings being ignored intentionally. It also has a motive to show names I<even> for documents that won't be indexed
( And C<Module::Metadata> has no short term plans on exposing hidden document names ).

C<PPIx::DocumentName> also has special logic for the C<PODNAME: > declaration, and may eventually support other
mechanisms for extracting a name from "a document", which will be not in C<Module::Metadata>'s collection of desired
use-cases.

=item * L<< C<Module::Extract::Namespaces>|Module::Extract::Namespaces >> - This is probably closer to
C<PPIx::DocumentName>'s requirements, using C<PPI> to extract content.

Most of C<Module::Extract::Namespaces>'s code seems to be glue for legacy versions of C<PPI> and the remaining
code is for loading modules from C<@INC> ( Which we don't need ), or special casing IO ( Which is also not necessary,
as this module assumes you're moderately acquainted with C<PPI> and can do IO yourself )

C<Module::Extract::Namespaces> also obliterates document comments, which of course stands in the way of our auxiliary
requirements re C<PODNAME: > declarations.

It will also not be flexible enough to support other name extraction features we may eventually add.

And like C<Module::Metadata>, it also focuses on extracting I<many> C<package> declarations where this module prefers
to extract only the I<first>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The bulk of this logic was extrapolated from L<< C<Pod::Weaver::Section::Name>|Pod::Weaver::Section::Name >>
and a related role, L<< C<Pod::Weaver::Role::StringFromComment>|Pod::Weaver::Role::StringFromComment >>.

Thanks to L<< C<RJBS>|cpan:///author/RJBS >> for the initial implementation and L<< C<DROLSKY>|cpan:///author/DROLSKY >> for some of the improvement patches.
